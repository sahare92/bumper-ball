## What is Bumper Ball?

Bumper Ball is a revolutionary game that takes augmented reality to the next level by introducing a new way of integrating the digital and physical worlds:
a virtual soccer field, a ball, and other objects, are projected as images on to a real-world game board.
You use remote-control-activated toy cars to move the virtual ball around the board and score goals.
A camera is used to distinguish between the cars, based on their colors, and identify the cars' position and movement, including direction and velocity.
The game reacts to the changes in the physical world and changes the virtual game board accordingly, in real time.

## How to Play

Two players battle it out on the virtual soccer field.
Each player uses a remote control to drive a toy car across the game board.
The objective is to use your car to hit the virtual game ball into your opponent's goal and score goals, while preventing your opponent from scoring goals.
On the way, avoid the obstacles that appear on the board and pick up power-up gifts that provide you with advantages over your opponent (such as making their goal larger).
The winner is the player who scores the most goals within the allocated time.
